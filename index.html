        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <p>I am a PhD Candidate in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>. My research broadly focuses on <b>Human-AI Interaction, Social Computing, and Health & Wellbeing</b>, with an emphasis on <strong>helping people meaningfully engage with AI in complex information environments and health contexts</strong>. I adopt a theory-guided approach using both computational and qualitative methods to understand the role of technology in addressing or exacerbating problems in the information environment, public health, social interactions, and individual well-being. I am a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/">Social Dynamics and Wellbeing (SocWeB) Lab</a> under the advisory of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.munmund.net/">Dr. Munmun De Choudhury</a>.</p>


        <p>While technology has democratized information access and authorship, it also presents unique challenges for individuals in assessing information quality and reliability. These challenges have become more pronounced with the emergence of Generative AI technologies like large language models (LLMs), which can produce low-quality content (such as inaccurate or biased information) with high scalability and persuasiveness. I adopt a human-centered approach to contextualizing and mitigating harms of using AI to meet health informational needs. Specifically, my research explores both the risks associated with utilizing AI’s generative abilities for informational needs and the broader public discourse and perceptions surrounding them.

        <p>My research has been published at premier computing venues, such as CHI, CSCW, and ACL, and has been recognized by paper awards at CHI and CSCW and the Foley Scholar Award (Georgia Tech highest award for study excellence in research contributions to computing).</p>

            Large language models have abilities in creating high-volume human-like texts and can be used to generate persuasive misinformation. However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work first examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found significant linguistic differences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a significant performance drop compared to   human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had questionable applicability, as AI-misinfo tended to meet criteria in evidence credibility, source transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. We discuss implications for practitioners, researchers, and journalists, as AI can create new challenges to the societal problem of misinformation.

            Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have generated both interest and concern about their potential adoption as information sources or communication tools across different domains. In public health, where stakes are high and impacts extend across diverse populations, adopting LLMs poses unique challenges that require thorough evaluation. However, structured approaches for assessing potential risks in public health remain under-explored. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups with public health professionals and individuals with lived experience to unpack their concerns, situated across three distinct and critical public health issues that demand high-quality information: infectious disease prevention (vaccines), chronic and well-being care (opioid use disorder), and community health and safety (intimate partner violence). We synthesize participants' perspectives into a risk taxonomy, distinguishing and contextualizing the potential harms LLMs may introduce when positioned alongside traditional health communication. This taxonomy highlights four dimensions of risk to individuals, human-centered care, information ecosystem, and technology accountability. For each dimension, we discuss specific risks and offer example reflection questions to help practitioners adopt a risk-reflexive approach. We discuss the need to revisit pre-existing mental models of help-seeking and complement evaluations with external validity and domain expertise through lived experience and real-world practices. Together, this work contributes a shared vocabulary and reflection tool for people in both computing and public health to collaboratively anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate risks in deciding when to employ LLM capabilities (or not) and how to mitigate harm.

            During times of crisis, heightened anxiety and fear create fertile ground for hate speech and misinformation, as people are more likely to fall for and be influenced by it. This paper looks into the interwoven relationship between anti-Asian hatred and COVID-19 misinformation amid the pandemic. By analyzing 785,798 Asian hate tweets and surveying 308 diverse participants, this empirical study explores how hateful content portrays the Asian community, including its truthfulness and targets, as well as what makes such portrayals harmful. We observed a high prevalence of misinformative hate speech that was lengthier, less emotional, and expressed more motivational drives than general hate speech. Overall, we found that anti-Asian rhetoric was characterized by an antagonism and inferiority framing, with misinformative hate underscoring antagonism and general hate emphasizing calls for action. Among all entities being explicitly criticized, China and the Chinese were constantly named to assign blame, with misinformative hate more likely to finger-point than general hate. Our survey results indicated that hateful messages with misinformation, demographic targeting, or divisive references were perceived as significantly more damaging. Individuals who placed less importance on free speech, had personal encounters with hate speech, or believed in the natural origin of COVID-19 were more likely to perceive higher severity. Taken together, this work highlights the distinct compositions of hate within misinformative hate speech that influences perceived harmfulness and adds to the complexity of defining and moderating harmful content. We discuss the implications for designing more context- and culture-sensitive counter-strategies and building more adaptive and explainable moderation approaches.
